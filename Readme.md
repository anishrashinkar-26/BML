2. Experiments

2.1 Experiment 01 - Extract Data from Database  
Objective: Connect to a database and extract structured data using Python.  
Tools Used: sqlite3, pandas  
Description: Created a sample SQLite database with student records. Used SQL queries to extract data and displayed it using pandas DataFrame.

2.2 Experiment 02 - Data Preprocessing Techniques  
Objective: Clean and prepare raw data for machine learning.  
Techniques Used: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling  
Libraries: pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.impute  
Description: Preprocessed a synthetic dataset by imputing missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical columns.

2.3 Experiment 03 - Simple Linear Regression  
Objective: Implement and visualize simple linear regression.  
Libraries Used: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy  
Description: Generated a synthetic dataset using make_regression. Trained a linear regression model and plotted the regression line over the data points.

2.4 Experiment 04 - Naive Bayes Classification  
Objective: Train and evaluate a Naive Bayes classifier.  
Dataset Used: Iris dataset  
Libraries: scikit-learn  
Description: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Trained a Gaussian Naive Bayes model and evaluated it using accuracy score and classification report.
